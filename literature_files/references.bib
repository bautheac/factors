  title = {What's driving food prices?},
  abstract = {Preface :  The temperature of the rhetoric in the  food-versus-fuel debate has been rising right along with  the prices of corn and oil. Farm Foundation is not about  heat or fueling fires. Our mission is to be a catalyst for  sound public policy by providing objective information to  foster deeper understanding of the complex issues before  the food system today. We commissioned this paper to  provide a comprehensive, objective assessment of the forces  driving food prices. In recent months, much has been  written in the academic and popular press about commodity  prices, biofuels and food prices—often with varying  perspectives and conclusions. Farm Foundation asked Wallace  Tyner, Philip Abbot and Christopher Hurt, all of Purdue  University, to review the literature and provide a  comprehensive assessment of the forces driving food prices  today. The three economists reviewed more than two dozen  reports and studies, summarizing them in light of their own  examination of the facts. As is true of many issues in the  food system, the full story behind rapid increases in food  prices is not a simple one. Today’s food price levels are  the result of complex interactions among multiple  factors—including crude oil prices, exchange rates,  growing demand for food and slowing growth in agricultural  productivity—as well as the agricultural, energy and  trade policy choices made by nations of the world. But one  simple fact stands out: economic growth and rising human  aspirations are putting ever greater pressure on the global  resource base. The difficult challenge for public and  private leaders is to identify policy choices that help the  world deal with the very real problems created by today’s  rising food prices without jeopardizing aspirations for the  future. It is the intent of Farm Foundation that the  objective information provided in this report will help all  stakeholders meet the challenge to address one of the most  critical public policy issues facing the world today.},

  shorttitle = {Limits to Arbitrage and Hedging},
  abstract = {Motivated by the literature on limits-to-arbitrage, we build an equilibrium model of commodity markets in which speculators are capital constrained, and commodity producers have hedging demands for commodity futures. Increases (decreases) in producers' hedging demand (speculators' risk-capacity) increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures, reduce producers' inventory holdings, and thus spot prices. Consistent with our model, producers' default risk forecasts futures returns, spot prices, and inventories in oil and gas market data from 1980-2006, and the component of the commodity futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces. We conclude that limits to financial arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers, and affect both asset and goods prices.},

Institutional investors care about their performance relative to a commodity index. We find that all commodity futures prices, volatilities, and correlations go up with financialization, but more so for index futures than for nonindex futures. The equity-commodity correlations also increase. We demonstrate how financial markets transmit shocks not only to futures prices but also to commodity spot prices and inventories. Spot prices go up with financialization, and shocks to any index commodity spill over to all storable commodity prices.},

Evidence suggests that linking volatility to total volume does not extract all information.

Further, the relation is asymmetric; the impact of positive unexpected volume shocks on volatility is larger than the impact of negative shocks. Finally, consistent with theories of market depth, the study shows large open interest mitigates volatility.},

The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables."}

We develop an equilibrium model of trader behavior that relates uninformed CIT trading to futures prices. A key implication of the model is that CIT trading reduces the cost of hedging. We test the model using a unique non-public dataset that allows us to precisely identify trader positions. We find evidence, consistent with the model, that index traders have become an important supply of price risk insurance.},

This development took place following what has been dubbed the ``financialization'' of commodity markets. We first document changes since 1995 in the relative importance of financial institutions' activity in agricultural futures markets. We then use a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model to ascertain the role of that activity in explaining correlations between weekly grain, livestock, and equity returns from 1995\textendash{}2015. We provide robust evidence that, accounting for shocks that are idiosyncratic to agricultural markets, world business cycle shocks have a substantial and long-lasting impact on the latter's co-movements with financial markets. In contrast, changes in the intensity of financial speculation have an impact on cross-market return linkages that is shorter-lived and not statistically significant in all model specifications.},

We find no such relationship for commodity swap dealers, including index traders (CITs). The predictive power of hedge fund positions is weaker in periods of generalized financial market stress. Our results support the notion that who trades helps predict the joint distribution of commodity and equity returns. We find qualitatively similar but statistically weaker results using a proxy for hedge fund activity based on publicly available data.},

We establish a theoretical link between growth options available to managers and the idiosyncratic risk of equity.

Accounting for growth options eliminates or reverses the trend in aggregate firm-specific risk. These results are robust for different measures of idiosyncratic volatility, different growth option proxies, across exchanges, and through time. Finally, our results suggest that growth options explain the trend in idiosyncratic volatility beyond alternative explanations.}",

This ``convective risk flow'' induced by the greater distress of financial institutions led to a change in the allocation of risk with hedgers holding more risk than they did previously. The presence of such a risk flow confirms the market impact of financial traders conditional on trades they initiate.},

  volume = {43},
  issn = {0047-2530},
  abstract = {This paper discusses some of the challenges faced by a policy treatment of speculative trading that is motivated by differences in beliefs. The first challenge is philosophical. Suppose two investors prefer to speculate with each other, under the common knowledge that they are motivated to trade purely by a difference in beliefs (unconditional probability assessments). In the absence of third-party costs, are there conditions under which society should try to prevent them from doing so? The second challenge is the existence of a rationale for a policy based on beliefs, as distinct from other determinants of risk preferences. The third challenge is the ability of enforcement agencies to monitor the distinction between belief-motivated trade and trade motivated by more obvious welfare-enhancing activities, such as hedging, liquidity provision, or acquiring payoff-relevant information.},

I capture the limits of arbitrage that govern these transactions within a simple asset pricing model, which predicts that the price of aggregate commodity risk decreases in the relative leverage of the broker-dealer sector. This prediction receives strong empirical support in the data. Fluctuations in broker-dealer risk-bearing capacity have particularly strong forecasting power for energy returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample.},

This interpretation has been driving policy efforts to tighten the regulation of oil derivatives markets. This survey reviews the evidence supporting this view. We identify six strands in the literature and discuss to what extent each sheds light on the role of speculation. We find that the existing evidence is not supportive of an important role of speculation in driving the spot price of oil after 2003. Instead, there is strong evidence that the co-movement between spot and futures prices reflects common economic fundamentals rather than the financialization of oil futures markets.},

 abstract = {This paper develops and empirically tests a two-factor model for pricing financial and real assets contingent on the price of oil. The factors are the spot price of oil and the instantaneous convenience yield. The parameters of the model are estimated using weekly oil futures contract prices from January 1984 to November 1988, and the model's performance is assessed out of sample by valuing futures contracts over the period November 1988 to May 1989. Finally, the model is applied to determine the present values of one barrel of oil deliverable in one to ten years time.},

Our analysis supports earlier conclusions that Granger-causal impacts are generally not discernible. However, market microstructure theory suggests trading impacts should be instantaneous. IV-based tests for contemporaneous causality provide stronger evidence of price impact. We find even stronger evidence that changes in index positions can help predict future changes in aggregate commodity price indices. This result suggests that changes in index investment are in part driven by information which predicts commodity price changes over the coming months.},

This feedback effect from the financial market to the investment decision gives rise to trading frenzies, in which speculators all wish to trade like others, generating large pressure on prices. Coordination among speculators is sometimes desirable for price informativeness and investment efficiency, but speculators' incentives push in the opposite direction, so that they coordinate exactly when it is undesirable. We analyze the effect of various market parameters on the likelihood of trading frenzies to arise.}

We identify a source for strategic complementarities in trading and information acquisition: aggressive trading on information about one fundamental reduces uncertainty in trading on information about the other fundamental, encouraging more trading and information acquisition on that fundamental. This tends to amplify the effect of exogenous changes in the underlying information environment. Due to complementarities, greater diversity of information in the economy improves price informativeness. We discuss the relation between our model and recent financial phenomena and derive testable empirical implications.},

The growth opportunities of defense firms, compared with other firms, increased substantially during the Reagan defense buildup of the early 1980s but then declined significantly with the end of the cold war and associated defense budget cuts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We examine how the level and structure of corporate debt changed for a sample of 61 defense firms and a benchmark sample of 61 manufacturing firms during 1980–95, a period spanning the changes in growth opportunities. The debt levels of weapons manufacturers, which were most affected by the changes in growth opportunities, increased significantly as their growth opportunities declined. In addition, these firms lengthened the maturity structure of their debt, decreased the ratio of private to public debt, and decreased the use of senior debt as their growth opportunities declined. The results complement other studies that have found cross-sectional relations between proxies for growth opportunities and leverage variables and validate the prominent role played by growth opportunities in the theory of corporate finance.}

Based upon the model developed in Part 1 of this paper, the statistical framework is derived for both parametric and nonparametric tests of market-timing ability.

If the manager's forecasts are not observable, then the parametric test can be used under the assumption of either a capital asset pricing model or a multifactor return structure. The tests differ from earlier work because they permit identification and separation of the gains of market-timing skills from the gains of micro stock-selection skills.},

  abstract = {This paper examines equilibrium in a spot and futures market with both primary producers (growers) and intermediate producers (processors). For a commodity that is subject to output shocks, processors tend to hedge long, in contrast with Hick's theory of futures hedging. Nevertheless, if transaction costs are low, the two-stage production process brings about a downward futures price bias, consistent with Hick's pricing prediction. But if costs of trading futures are high, growers tend to be differentially driven from the futures market, reversing the direction of the bias. Futures trading may also affect the organization of industry; when demand is inelastic, futures trading can serve as a substitute for vertical integration as a means of diversifying risk because the risk positions of growers are complementary with those of processors.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis paper examines the determinants of commodity futures hedging and of risk premia arising from covariation of the futures price with stock market returns, and with the revenues of producers. Owing to supply shocks that stochastically redistribute real wealth (surplus) between producers and consumers, and to limited participation in the futures market, the total risk premium in the model is not proportional to the contract's covariance with aggregate consumption. Stock market variability interacts with the incentive to hedge, causing the producer hedging component of the risk premium to increase (decrease) with income elasticity, for a normal (inferior) good. Production costs that depend on output raise the premium. We argue that output and demand shocks will typically be positively correlated, raising the premium. High supply elasticity reduces the absolute heding premium by reducing the variability of spot price and revenue.},

  abstract = {Optimal futures hedging and equilibrium futures price bias are examined in a model characterized by two consumption goods, one of which has stochastically varying output, and where information arrives sequentially. Positive (negative) complementarity in consumer preferences promotes downward (upward) bias in the futures price viewed as a predictor of the later spot price. I demonstrate that the conclusion derived from partial equilibrium analysis--that when speculators are risk averse, risk premia are a function of hedging pressure--fails in the general equilibrium analysis, so long as there are no transaction costs. A counterexample is analyzed in which, as consumers' additive logarithmic preferences are varied, producers' hedging positions change from long to short, while the futures risk premium remains unchanged. However, hedging pressure is reinstated as a force influencing risk premia in the sense that the futures price is downward biased when hedgers take short positions and is upward biased when hedgers take long positions, provided it can be assumed (as is usually valid) that fixed setup costs of trading deter consumers more than producers from participating in the futures market.},

We assess whether speculation in the oil market played a role in driving this salient empirical pattern. We identify oil shocks from a large dataset using a dynamic factor model. This method is motivated by the fact that a small-scale vector autoregression is not informationally sufficient to identify the shocks. The main results are as follows. (i) While global demand shocks account for the largest share of oil price fluctuations, speculative shocks are the second most important driver. (ii) The increase in oil prices over the last decade is mainly driven by the strength of global demand. However, speculation played a significant role in the oil price increase between 2004 and 2008 and its subsequent collapse. (iii) The co-movement between oil prices and the prices of other commodities is mainly explained by global demand shocks. Our results support the view that the recent oil price increase is mainly driven by the strength of global demand but that the financialization process of commodity markets also played a role.},

Third, a simple model of the price-volume relation is proposed that is consistent with several seemingly unrelated or contradictory observations.

Contrary to the popular belief that speculators are responsible for the recent commodity price fluctuation, my analysis finds no evidence that speculators destabilize the commodity spot market. Instead, speculators contribute to lower price volatility, enhanced price efficiency, and better liquidity in the commodity markets. More importantly, I show that speculators either have no effect or stabilize prices during periods of large price movement. My findings suggest speculators have had a significant and in fact positive influence on the commodity market during the recent ``financialization'' period, implying that restricting speculative trading in the futures market is not an efficient way to stabilize the commodity market.},

  abstract = {A dynamic model of insider trading with sequential auctions, structured to resemble a sequential equilibrium, is used to examine the informational content of prices, the liquidity characteristics of a speculative market, and the value of private information to an insider. The model has three kinds of traders: a single risk neutral insider, random noise traders, and competitive risk neutral market makers. The insider makes positive profits by exploiting his monopoly power optimally in a dynamic context, where noise trading provides camouflage which conceals his trading from market makers. As the time interval between auctions goes to zero, a limiting model of continuous trading is obtained. In this equilibrium, prices follow Brownian motion, the depth of the market is constant over time, and all private information is incorporated into prices by the end of trading.},

It is shown that the pattern of returns from successful market timing has an isomorphic correspondence to the pattern of returns from following certain option investment strategies. This correspondence is used to derive a unique equilibrium price structure of management fees which are independent of investors' preferences, endowments, or prior probability assessments for stock returns. Sufficient statistics for evaluating market-timing skills are derived, and it is shown that the number of correct forecasts is not a useful statistic for this purpose.},

We find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. A diversified portfolio of time series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and performs best during extreme markets. Examining the trading activities of speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series momentum at the expense of hedgers.},

Methods of analysis, which are appropriate under special conditions, are described in the context of an isolated market with a fixed production lag.

We re-examine some of the early papers in the literature using recent data and find that the empirical support for the theory of normal backwardation as an explanation for the commodity risk premium is weak and that the evidence is more consistent with storage decisions. We then review the behavior of the main participants in the commodity futures markets with a particular focus on their impact on prices. Although there is continued disagreement in the literature about the role of speculative activity, our results show that money managers are generally momentum (positive feedback) traders, while producers are net short and contrarian (negative feedback) traders. There is less evidence that index traders and swap dealers trade based on past futures returns.},

 abstract = {Der freie Wettbewerb bringt stets ganz bestimmte räumliche Preisgefälle hervor. Ebenso wird er stets bestimmte Preisgefälle in der Zeit hervorrufen, wobei man dem zukünftigen Preis einer Ware, soweit die Kenntnis aller einschlägigen Faktoren reicht, niemals erlauben wird, den gegenwärtigen Preis um mehr als die Kosten der Speicherung zu übersteigen. Die Theorie der Spekulation, auf der all dies beruht, ist äußerst kompliziert auf Grund der überall wirksamen Unsicherheit über die Zukunft. Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt also einen Überblick über die exakten Beziehungen, die auf einem idealen Warenmarkt unter der abstrakten und idealen Voraussetzung einer vollkommenen Kenntnis aller Faktoren herrschen würden. Im besonderen wird dargelegt, wie eine vorhergesehene oder unvorhergesehene Störung das Preisgefälle und den Verbrauch verschiedener Ernteperioden beeinflußt. In einem Anhang werden einige der interessanten mathematischen Probleme, die mit der reinen Theorie der Spekulation zusammenhängen, entwickelt. Eine intuitive Darlegung der Grundprinzipien kann allerdings einfach dadurch erreicht werden, daß man die Diagramme der elementaren Außenhandelstheorie verwendet. Schließlich werden einige Bemerkungen zu bestimmten Wirkungen der Unsicherheit vorgetragen. Insbesondere wird die Auffassung kritisiert, nach der jeder erfolgreich Spekulierende damit schon als ein Wohltäter der Gesamtheit angesehen werden muß, der in seinem Gewinn den "verdienten" Lohn empfängt. Wer eine Sekunde eher als die anderen den Schleier der Ungewißheit durchschaut, kann Riesengewinne erzielen, ohne daß es für die gesamte Wirtschaft irgendeine Bedeutung hat, ob die Anpassung des Preises eine Sekunde früher oder später geschieht.},

I decompose traders' average portfolio risks into two components: the uninsurable variance, defined as portfolio risks that would obtain without belief disagreements, and the speculative variance, defined as portfolio risks that result from speculation. My main result shows that financial innovation always increases the speculative variance through two distinct channels: by generating new bets and by amplifying traders' existing bets. When disagreements are large, these effects are sufficiently strong that financial innovation increases average portfolio risks, decreases average portfolio comovements, and generates greater speculative trading volume relative to risk-sharing volume. Moreover, a profit-seeking market maker endogenously introduces speculative assets that increase average portfolio risks. JEL Codes: G11, G12, D53.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the impact of investor flows and financial market conditions on returns in crude oil futures markets. I argue that informational frictions and the associated speculative activity may induce prices to drift away from ``fundamental'' values, and may result in price booms and busts. Particular attention is given to the interplay between imperfect information about real economic activity, including supply, demand, and inventory accumulation, and speculative activity in oil markets. Furthermore, I present new evidence that there were economically and statistically significant effects of investor flows on futures prices, after controlling for returns in the United States and emerging-economy stock markets, a measure of the balance sheet flexibility of large financial institutions, open interest, the futures/spot basis, and lagged returns on oil futures. The largest impacts on futures prices were from intermediate-term growth rates of index positions and managed-money spread positions. Moreover, my findings suggest that these effects were through risk or informational channels distinct from changes in convenience yield. Finally, the evidence suggests that hedge fund trading in spread positions in futures impacted the shape of term structure of oil futures prices. This paper was accepted by Wei Xiong, finance.},

By aggregating dispersed information about the strength of the global economy among goods producers whose production has complementarity, commodity prices serve as price signals to guide producers' production decisions and commodity demand. Our model highlights important feedback effects of informational noise originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity demand and spot prices. Our analysis illustrates the weakness common in empirical studies on commodity markets of assuming that different types of shocks are publicly observable to market participants.},

 abstract = {In this article we compare three models of the stochastic behavior of commodity prices that take into account mean reversion, in terms of their ability to price existing futures contracts, and their implication with respect to the valuation of other financial and real assets. The first model is a simple one-factor model in which the logarithm of the spot price of the commodity is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. The second model takes into account a second stochastic factor, the convenience yield of the commodity, which is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. Finally, the third model also includes stochastic interest rates. The Kalman filter methodology is used to estimate the parameters of the three models for two commercial commodities, copper and oil, and one precious metal, gold. The analysis reveals strong mean reversion in the commercial commodity prices. Using the estimated parameters, we analyze the implications of the models for the term structure of futures prices and volatilities beyond the observed contracts, and for hedging contracts for future delivery. Finally, we analyze the implications of the models for capital budgeting decisions.},

 abstract = {Die Nachkriegsdiskussion über internationale Rohstoffprobleme hat dazu geführt, daß man einen festen Kurs zwischen der Skylla der Instabilität einerseits und der Charybdis der monopolistischen Praktiken seitens der Erzeuger oder Verbraucher von Rohstoffen anderseits anstrebte. In der Diskussion wurde fast gar nicht auf die Funktionen organisierter Rohstoffmärkte Bezug genommen, was allerdings überraschend ist, da organisierte Märkte sehr wohl gerade gegen Instabilität des Marktes und monopolistische Praktiken Schutz gewähren könnten. Die Aufgaben von Rohstoffmärkten werden teilweise durch Börsen und teilweise durch die Handelstätigkeit verschiedener Gruppen, die an der Rohstoffbörse operieren, übernommen. Der Aufsatz enthält auch eine Erörterung der Strukturmerkmale, die bewirken, daß die Terminmärkte dem theoretischen vollkommenen Wettbewerb nahekommen. Es wird ferner die Frage behandelt, wie die verschiedenen Kategorien von Händlern eine enge Preisbeziehung zwischen den verschiedenen Märkten herstellen. Der Einfluß der Entwicklung des Nachkriegshandels auf Rohstoff-Terminmärkte wird diskutiert. Es wird festgestellt, daß der Handel auf zahlreichen Märkten in den sechziger Jahren zugenommen hat, während andere Märkte in einem bösen Zirkel der Stagnation zurückblieben. Die Untersuchung ergibt, daß ein richtiges Funktionieren der organisierten Märkte die Koordinierung der nationalen Rohstoffpolitik und der internationalen Rohstoffabkommen erfordert.},

 abstract = {The role that futures markets play in guiding inventories, through hedging, has been emphasized in economic literature. Historically, futures markets first emerged for the annual crops that could be continuously stored (grain and cotton); hence inventory hedging has been important from the outset. But forward pricing which was not attendant upon inventories has long been practiced, and the more recent emergence of futures markets for non-inventory commodities dramatizes this fact. We show here that the model of intertemporal price relationships differs for the two cases and provide evidence for selected commodities. The contrasting implications for allocation and stabilization are also drawn.},

The main aspect which is emphasized is the provision of information by such a market. It provides efficient forecasts which facilitates both production and storage decisions, as a result of which the stability of spot prices is generally increased. The allocation of the benefits from a futures market to the various groups in the economy is discussed andthe present results related to those of the more traditional buffer stock literature. Finally, the degree of stability provided by a futures market is compared with that obtained by active market intervention by a stabilization authority."

A critical aspect is how the parameters of these functions change with the introduction of the future market as it is through these induced parameter changes that the futures market exerts its influence on the spot price. The effects of the futures market on both the long-run average spot price and its variance are analyzed. While we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions on this issue, we find that in all cases considered the futures market stabilizes the spot price, as well as lowering its long-run mean.},

The following assumptions are made: (A.1) The instantaneous (spot) interest rate follows a diffusion process; (A.2) the price of a discount bond depends only on the spot rate over its term; and (A.3) the market is efficient. Under these assumptions, it is shown by means of an arbitrage argument that the expected rate of return on any bond in excess of the spot rate is proportional to its standard deviation. This property is then used to derive a partial differential equation for bond prices. The solution to that equation is given in the form of a stochastic integral representation. An interpretation of the bond pricing formula is provided. The model is illustrated on a specific case."

	abstract = {This article examines the behavior and performance of speculators and hedgers in 15 U.S. futures markets. We find that after controlling for market risk factors, speculators are contrarians, but respond positively to market sentiment. In contrast, hedgers engage in positive feedback trading and trade against market sentiment. We also find that trades of speculators (hedgers) are positively (negatively) correlated with subsequent abnormal returns; however, it does not appear that speculators possess superior forecasting power. Therefore, hedging pressure effects likely explain the negative relation between the performance of speculators and hedgers. The positive feedback trading by hedgers together with their negative performance suggests that hedgers have a destabilizing impact on futures prices. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title = {The financialization of storable commodities},
  abstract = {I construct a dynamic equilibrium model of storable commodities populated by producers, dealers, and households. When financial innovation allows households to trade in futures markets, they choose a long position that leads to lower equilibrium excess returns on futures, a more frequently upward-sloping futures curve, and higher volatility in futures and spot markets. The effect on spot price levels is modest, and extremely high spot prices only occur in conjunction with low inventories and poor productivity. Therefore such "financialization'' of commodities may explain several recently observed changes in spot and futures market dynamics, but it cannot directly account for a large increase in spot prices.},

  abstract = {We study how commodity financialization affects information transmission and aggregation in a commodity futures market. The trading of financial traders injects both fundamental information and unrelated noise into the futures price. Thus, price informativeness in the futures market can either increase or decrease with commodity financialization. When the price-informativeness effect is negative, the futures price bias can increase with the population size of financial traders. Commodity financialization generally improves market liquidity in the futures market and strengthens the comovement between the futures market and the equity market. We find that operating profits and producer welfare move in opposite directions in response to commodity financialization, which provides important guidance for interpreting related empirical and policy studies.},

  abstract = {We develop an equilibrium model of commodity spot and futures markets in which commodity production, consumption, and speculation are endogenously determined. Speculators facilitate hedging by the commodity suppliers. The entry of new speculators thus increases the supply of the commodity and decreases the expected spot prices, to the benefits of the end-users. However, this entry may be detrimental to the producers, as they do not internalize the price reduction due to greater aggregate supply. In the presence of asymmetric information, speculation on the futures market serves as a learning device. The futures price and open interest reveal different pieces of private information regarding the supply and demand side of the spot market, respectively. When the accuracy of private information is low, the entry of new speculators makes both production and spot prices more volatile. The entry of new speculators typically increases the correlation between financial and commodity markets.},
